🏓 2-Player Ping Pong Game

Welcome to my 2-player ping pong game! 🎮 This game simulates a classic table tennis match, where two players compete to score points by controlling their bats and hitting the ball back and forth. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game! 🌟

🕹️ Gameplay Instructions

Player 1 (Left-side Bat) controls the bat using the following keys:
Move Up: W,
Move Down: S,
Move Left: A,
Move Right: D,

Player 2 (Right-side Bat) controls the bat using the arrow keys:

Move Up: ↑,
Move Down: ↓,
Move Left: ←,
Move Right: →,

The goal is to score 10 points by successfully returning the ball past your opponent's bat!

🎉 Have Fun and Good Luck!
